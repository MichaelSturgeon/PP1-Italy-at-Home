                    <p>The traditional Galician tart with origin in the Middle Ages and made with ground almonds, eggs
                        and sugar. The top of the Tarta de Santiago, its original name, is decorated with powdered
                        sugar.</p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 recipe of your favorite pie crust or one already prepared store-bought crust</li>
                    <li>1 stick of unsalted butter room temperature (if using salted butter, eliminate the pinch of salt)</li>
                    <li>½ pound almond paste see notes above in filling ingredients, cut into chunks</li>
                    <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
                    <li>2 eggs at room temperature</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup flour</li>
                    <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                    <li>¾ cup of your favorite jam or preserves traditional and my personal fave is sour cherry</li>
                    <li>¼ cup sliced almonds</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="recipe-method">
                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oven to 350 fahrenheit</li>
                    <li>Press the pastry dough into a 9-inch tart pan (the kind with a removable bottom). Take your jam
                        and spread across thhe pie crust. YOu want a good thick layer, so if you want to use a little
                        extra, I wouldn't say no. Put the dough in the fridge while you make the rest.</li>
                    <li>In the bowl of your electric mixer (use the whisk attachment for this one), or a bowl for a hand
                        mixer, beat the butter until smooth. With the mixer on low, add the chunks of almond paste, one
                        at a time, mixing each in before adding the next. Keep mixing on low and add the sugar. Then add
                        the eggs one at a time. Add the pinch of salt. Turn the mixer on medium and beat well, to
                        thoroughly combine. Turn back to low and stir in the flour just until combined.</li>
                    <li>Spoon the almond mixture on top of the jam and spread evenly and smooth. Bake this for about 40
                        minutes. The top should be firm to the touch and evenly puffed (not a big puff, just a little).
                    </li>
                    <li>Cool on wire rack completely before serving.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div id="recipe-tips">
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cut the almond paste into pieces before adding. If you dump the whole block in the mixer at one
                        time, it will be messy. Sh-t will fly out all over the place.</li>
                    <li>Try to use room temperature everything. So when working with room temperature butter in baking, you really
                        want everything to be room temperature so you don't make the butter cold and chunky or make it melty
                        and runny. And by everything, I am really talking about the eggs. Eggs are usually kept in the
                        fridge. If you forgot to take them out of fridge to come up to temperature, no problem. Fill a bowl
                        with decently warm water and put the whole eggs in there for about 10 minutes. This will take
                        the chill out.</li>
