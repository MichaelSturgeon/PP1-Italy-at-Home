                    <p>Unlike popular thought, Bolognese originated in the city of Imola (a little west of Bologna).
                        Imola is the birthplace of the earliest documented ragù sauce - dating all the way back to the
                        18th century. In our recipe, we've given you two options: make your own pasta and ragù following
                        the traditional steps (which typically takes about two hours) or use authentic pasta to create a
                        dish in half an hour.</p>

                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a heavy Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, melt the butter with the
                        olive oil. Add the onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, about 5
                        minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the carrot, celery, and garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and fragrant,
                        about 2 minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Crumble the veal, pork, and beef into the pot. Season with fine sea salt. Reduce the heat to low
                        and cook, stirring frequently, until the meat has rendered most of its fat and is just beginning
                        to brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Spoon out and discard some of the rendered fat, but leave enough to cover the bottom of the pan.
                        (This will depend on the meat you're using: there may not be an excessive amount of fat.)</li>
                    <li>Add the wine, and increase the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the wine has
                        evaporated, about 6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Decrease the heat to low, add the tomato paste, stir to combine, and cook, stirring frequently,
                        for 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the stock and adjust the heat if
                        necessary to reach a gentle simmer. Simmer until the stock has reduced but the sauce is still
                        moist, about 45 minutes longer. Taste the sauce, adjust the seasoning if necessary, and remove
                        from the heat.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. When the water is boiling, salt it with
                        coarse salt and add the pasta. Cook a few minutes less than package instructions if dry or until
                        the pasta rises to the surface if fresh.</li>
                    <li>When the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander, preserving a small amount of the cooking
                        water. Transfer immediately to the saucepan, and toss vigorously to combine and allow the pasta
                        to cook a final minute in the sauce. If needed, add a small amount of the cooking water, to
                        loosen the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately with the grated cheese on the side.</li>
                </ol>
