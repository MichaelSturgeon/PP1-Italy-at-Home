                    <p>How did rice, the staple of Asia, end up some 4,700 miles away, in wheat-focused Italy? It was
                        due to the Silk Road trade when Arab traders brought rice from Asia to the Middle East. Many
                        locals in Italy highly value this creamy rice delicacy, and even prefer it over the globally
                        more renowned and loved pizza or pasta.</p>

                    <li>2 fresh thyme sprigs</li>

                    <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>

                    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>

                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Warm broth over low heat in a small saucepan.</li>
                    <li>In a heavy skillet melt half of the butter over medium heat. Add mushrooms and shallots and
                        saute until tender, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, thyme sprigs, salt and pepper and stir for an
                        additional minute. Remove mushroom mixture from pan and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add remaining butter to pan over medium heat. Once melted, add rice and stir until rice begins
                        to look translucent, 3-4 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add ¾ cup dry white wine and lemon juice and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly until liquid
                        is absorbed. Add mushroom stock or 1 cup of vegetable broth and stir until almost all broth is
                        absorbed. Continuing adding broth 1 cup at a time, and stir until liquid is almost absorbed.
                        (This step takes 20-25 minutes.)</li>
                    <li>Add mushrooms mixture into the rice and stir to combine. Gently stir in heavy cream and parmesan
                        cheese and cook for an additional 5 min on low heat. Risotto should be creamy, but firm to the
                        bite. Transfer risotto to a serving bowl and top with freshly ground pepper, shaved parmesan and
                        fresh parsley.</li>

                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't rinse the rice—the rice's outer coating is where most of the starch is, and it's this rice
                        starch that makes for a creamy risotto.</li>
                    <li>The most involved part of making risotto is the constant stirring, but it's really not as bad as
                        it sounds.</li>
