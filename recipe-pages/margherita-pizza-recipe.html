                    <p>The city of Naples in Italy is widely known to be the home of pizza. Napels was founded as early
                        as the 16th-century. The majority of the population was very poor and so pizza - flatbread with
                        toppings that was sold by street vendors and could be eaten for any meal - met the needs of
                        Neapolitans as a food that could be eaten quickly and was cheap.</p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 batch easy whole wheat pizza dough or 1 pound store-bought pizza dough</li>
                    <li>1 large can (28 ounces) whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
                    <li>12 ounces (dry weight) ovoline-type mozzarella or other fresh mozzarella balls, ideally
                        water-packed</li>
                    <li>Handful of fresh basil, thinly sliced plus small leaves</li>
                    <li>Additional garnishes: Drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, flaky sea salt or kosher salt and
                        optional red pepper flakes</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. If you're
                        using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack. Prepare dough through step 5.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place a medium mixing bowl in the sink and pour the canned tomatoes into the bowl, juices and
                        all. Crush the tomatoes by hand. Spread about ¾ cup of the tomato sauce evenly over each pizza,
                        leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges.</li>
                    <li>If your mozzarella is packed in water, drain off the water and gently pat the mozzarella dry on
                        a clean tea towel or paper towels. If you're working with large mozzarella balls, tear them into
                        smaller 1-inch balls. Distribute the mozzarella over the pizza, concentrating it a bit more in
                        the center of the pizza, as it will melt toward the edges.</li>
                    <li>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is just
                        turning golden, about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you're using a baking
                        stone/steel—keep an eye on it).</li>
                    <li>Top each pizza generously with fresh basil, followed by a light back-and-forth drizzle of olive
                        oil, a sprinkling of salt, and red pepper flakes, if you wish. Slice and enjoy. Leftover pizza
                        will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vegan alternative: While untraditional, this pizza would be good with vegan sour cream drizzled across the pizza both before and after baking. Simply omit the Parmesan in the pizza crust recipe.</li>
                    <li>Gluten free alternative: Substitute your favorite homemade or store-bought pizza dough.</li>
