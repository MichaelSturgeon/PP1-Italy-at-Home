# Italy at Home

## Introduction
Italy at Home is a website with authenticity at the heart of every recipe. This site will be useful to anyone looking to level up their dining experience, simply by following one of the user friendly step by step recipes.

## User Experience Design
Throughout every stage of the development of this project I've considered how all features play a role in creating a positive user experience. Every time I've added a new feature I've assessed how it positivity impacts the used. When creating this project I was significantly influenced by the five planes of UXD.

## Strategy Plane

The purpose of the project is to provide the user with easy to understand recipes, using simple language and accessible ingredients to create authentic Italian meals.

### Project objectives 

- Provide the user with immediate understand of what the website intestates without the need to investigate further.
    
- Provide easy navigation between web pages, throughout the entirety of the experience.
    
- Invoke wholesome feelings of desire and joy.
    
- Provide the user with consistency throughout the site, avoiding disorganised content.
    
- Connect the user to the recipes through brief segments of food history and origin.
    
- Provide users with the opportunity to interact with the creator of the website.

With the above in mind I have conducted peer research to understand what users look for in a recipe website. I have identified three main themes which are:

1.  To be able to access different meal courses without the need to visit multiple websites at once.
    
2.  To have a clear picture or image of the finished product, alongside the recipe.
    
3.  To have useful tips assisting the user in perfecting the recipe. 

As a result of this research, I intend the project to service starters, main courses and desserts, featuring a picture alongside each recipe. I also intend to include useful tips at the end of each recipe to guide the user.

## Scope Plane
With the strategy plane complete, I compared the project objectives with the peer research and found that although there was a lot of functionality to include, all elements would in-fact compliment each other.

I understood that producing a minimum viable product would allow me to keep early users satisfied with key features, and provide me with guidance in the way of feedback, so I decides to incorporating the following features first as these were necessary to meet user needs:

-   An about section with an introduction of the website goals.
    
-   A recipe section with three sub sections, starters, mains, desserts.
    
-   A sign up section, keeping the user connected to the website.

## Structure Plane

When creating the project, considering the need of first time users and circumstances around their likely use of the site, it was important that I used a structured layout to provide a product that was clear yet rich in content. I aimed to achieve this with the following:

- Provide context to a page on first glance with the use of images and give meaning to the content with use of headings and sub-headings, guiding the user though the different section of the page, without the page appearing too busy.
    
- Provide easy navigation across the site with a navbar that is simple in both form and function, with use of clear block-like elements, ensuring the navbar is always for site navigation.
    
- Add hover effects to page links, to highlight mouse placement when navigating the site.
    
- Ensure that all recipe pages are deployed in a separate browser window, allowing the user to keep track of their chosen recipe, and still browse the main site.
    
- Control the maximum width of page sections, to keep the content in clear view of the user.

## Surface Plane

### Project Features 

**Navigation bar**: acts as the users main method for moving around the site by allowing them to easily switch between pages, with the logo on the left and the page links on the right. The active link in the navbar will be coloured white, leaving all inactive links coloured grey. The logo acts as a link to the home page.

- Mobile phones: The navbar presents a hamburger menu which once pressed will reveal the page links.
    
- Tablet, Laptops, and desktops: The navbar makes use of the larger screen sizes and displays the page links without the need for a hamburger menu. For devices that use a mouse, the links will change colour upon hovering over them.
    

**Footer**: provides users with a secondary method for navigating throughout the website without the need to scroll back up to the navbar. The footer also displays social media links which will open in a new tab.

**Hero video**: captures the user’s attention. The looping video features on all main pages throughout the website, providing the user with basic controls allowing them to pause and rewind at their leisure.

**White background**: provides users with a clean, simplistic view of the content allowing the vibrant colours of the site to stand out and attract the viewer.

**Main content max-width**: on screens larger than 1200px the main content will cease to spread across the screen. This will keeps the user’s focus towards the centre of the page, amongst the rest of the content.

**Recipe links**: open in a new tab allowing the user to continue browsing the recipe page, without losing track of their selected recipes. 

### Features left to implement

- **Filter system**: allowing users to narrow down the recipes by category (once the website has been populated with more recipes).
    
- **Looping hero images**:  that advertise the websites most popular recipes, providing users with a direct link the recipe in question.
    
- **Recipe description box**: that users can toggle to get a brief description of a recipe before opening it in a new tab.
    
- **Recipe page links**: that will be displayed in the navbar allowing users to quickly jump to section on the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: used as the building blocks to structure the web pages.

- **Git**: used for version control with the use of Gitpod – allowing me to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
    
-   **CodeAnywhere**: was the chosen development environment (IDE) used to create the project.
    
-   **Google and Opera Development Tools:** used as the main method for finding and fixing bugs, and testing the responsivity of the site.
