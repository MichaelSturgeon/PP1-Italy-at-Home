# Italy at Home
![Italy at Home project displayed on different screen sizes](/documentation/amiresponsive-responsive.png)
## Introduction
Italy at Home is a website with authenticity at the heart of every recipe. This site will be
useful to anyone looking to level up their dining experience, simply by following one of the
user-friendly, step-by-step recipes. Therefore, the target audience of this site is users of all
ages looking to develop their cooking skills.

## User Experience Design
Throughout every stage of the development of this project, I have considered how all features
play a role in creating a positive user experience. Every time I added a new feature,
 I've assessed how it positivity impacts the user. When creating this project I was significantly
influenced by the five planes of UXD.

## Strategy Plane
The purpose of the project is to provide the user with easy-to-understand recipes, using  
simple language and accessible ingredients to create authentic Italian meals.
**Project objectives:**
- Provide the user with an immediate understanding of what the website entails, making the  
primary goal clear without the need to investigate further.  
- Provide easy navigation between web pages throughout the entirety of the experience.  
- Invoke wholesome feelings of desire and joy.  
- Provide the user with consistency throughout the site, avoiding disorganised content.  
- Connect the user to the recipes through brief segments of food history and origin.  
- Provide users with the opportunity to interact with the creator of the website.
  
With the above in mind, I have conducted peer research to understand what users look for  
in a recipe website. I have identified three main themes, which are:  
1. To be able to access different meal courses without the need to visit multiple  
websites at once.  
2. To have a clear picture or image of the finished product alongside the recipe.  
3. To have useful tips assisting the user in perfecting the recipe.  
As a result of this research, I intend the project to service starters, main courses, and  
desserts, featuring a picture alongside each recipe. I also intend to include useful tips at  
the end of each recipe to guide the user.

## Scope Plane
With the strategy plane complete, I compared the project objectives with the peer research  
and found that although there was a lot of functionality to include, all elements would in-  
fact compliment each other.  
I understood that producing a minimum viable product would allow me to keep early users  
satisfied with key features, and provide me with guidance in the way of feedback, so I  
decided to incorporate the following features first, as these were necessary to meet user  
needs:  
- An about section with an introduction of the website goals.  
- A recipe section with three sub-sections: starters, mains, and desserts.  
- Recipe information is displayed by priority, in the order in which the user would need it.  
- A sign-up section keeping the user connected to the website.

## Structure Plane
When creating the project, considering the needs of first-time users and circumstances  
around their likely use of the site, it was important that I used a structured layout to provide  
a product that was clear yet rich in content. I aimed to achieve this with the following:  
- Provide context to a page at first glance with the use of images and give meaning  
to the content with use of headings and sub-headings, guiding the user through the  
different section of the page, without the page appearing too busy.  
- Provide easy navigation across the site with a navbar that is simple in both form  
and function, with the use of clear block-like elements, ensuring the navbar is always  
for site navigation.  
- Add hover effects to page links to highlight mouse placement when navigating the  
site.  
- Ensure that all recipe pages are deployed in a separate browser window, allowing  
the user to keep track of their chosen recipe and still browse the main site.  
- Control the maximum width of page sections to keep the content in clear view of  
the user.

## Skeleton Plane
With the three previous planes in mind, the core values that make up this project haven't  
changed since conception, but the same cannot be said for the skeleton of the website.  
The initial idea was to have one page feature all of the content. However, at the halfway
point through the development process I reconsidered the overall amount of content that
was needed, as I felt there wasn't enough available to the user. In addition to this, adding  
more to a single page would have left the user feeling overwhelmed with the amount of  
content. I aimed to fix this by extending the website to three pages. Which would allow me  
to better organise the page content and provide the user with the necessary breathing room.

## Surface Plane
### Project Features
![Project key features on mobile](/documentation/features-mobile.png)
*This image shows the key features on mobile phones - drop-down navbar, footer with social media and page links*

![Project key features on desktop](/documentation/features-desktop.png)
*This image shows the key features on desktops - navbar hover effect, content max width, simple white background*

- **Navigation bar**: acts as the user's main method for moving around the site by allowing  
them to easily switch between pages, with the logo on the left and the page links on the  
right. The active link in the navbar will be coloured white, leaving all inactive links coloured  
grey to make for an unambiguous experience for the user. The logo acts as a link to the  
home page.  
  - **Mobile phones**: The navbar presents a hamburger menu, which once pressed will reveal  
the page links.  
  - **Tablets, laptops, and desktops**: The navbar makes use of the larger screen sizes and  
displays the page links without the need for a hamburger menu. For devices that use a  
mouse, the links will change colour upon hovering over them.
  
- **Footer**: provides users with a secondary method for navigating throughout the website  
without the need to scroll back up to the navbar. The footer also displays social media links  
which will open in a new tab.

- **Hero video**: captures the user’s attention. The looping video features on all main pages  
throughout the website, providing the user with basic controls allowing them to pause and  
rewind at their leisure. This also works towards the site owner's goal of triggering a positive  
emotional response from the user.

- **White background**: provides users with a clean, simplistic view of the content, allowing the  
vibrant colours of the site to stand out and attract the viewer.

- **Main content max-width**: on screens larger than 1200px, the main content will cease to  
spread across the screen. This will keep the user’s focus on the centre of the page,  
amongst the rest of the content.

- **Recipe links**: open in a new tab, allowing the user to continue browsing the recipe page,  
without losing track of their selected recipes.

### Features left to implement
- **Filter system**: allowing users to narrow down the recipes by category (once the website  
has been populated with more recipes).

- **Looping hero images**: that advertise the website's most popular recipes, providing  
users with a direct link to the recipe in question.

- **Recipe description box**: that users can toggle to get a brief description of a recipe  
before opening it in a new tab.

- **Recipe page links**: that will be displayed in the navbar, allowing users to quickly jump to  
section on the page.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: used as the building blocks to structure the web pages.    
- **CSS**: used to style the web page elements throughout the project.    
- **Google Fonts**: used to source the fronts across the website – front used: Montserrat  
Alternates.  
- **Font Awesome**: used to obtain the social media icons in the footer of the website.    
- **GitHub**: used to store the code for the project and deploy the site using GitHub pages.    
- **Git**: used for version control with the use of Gitpod, allowing me to commit to Git and  
Push to GitHub.  
- **CodeAnywhere**: was the chosen development environment (IDE) used to create the  
project.  
- **Google and Opera Development Tools**: used as the main method for finding and fixing  
bugs, and testing the responsiveness of the site.  
- **Pixelied**: was used to convert .jpg image files to .webp files.    
- **Lighthouse**: used for testing the performance and accessibility of the website.    
- **W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator**: were used to validate the pages of  
the project to ensure there were no errors.  
- **AmIResponsive**: used to create the responsive image in the README file.
    

## Testing
I tested this website across the following web browsers:  
- Google Chrome  
- Microsoft Edge  
- Opera

When testing the responsiveness of this website, I used Google Chrome Developer Tools to  
emulating the following devices:  
- Apple iPhone SE  
- Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max  
- Apple iPhone XR  
- Samsung Galaxy Note 3  
- Samsung Galaxy S8+
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra  
- Samsung Galaxy Fold  
- LG Optimus L70  
- Microsoft Lumia 950  
- iPad Mini  
- Kindle Fire HDX
     
I also field tested my site on several devices, which include:  
- Google Pixel 6  
- Google Pixel 7  
- iPhone 11

**Detected bugs and solutions**  
- The favicons were not displaying in the browser tab due to the recipe pages being  
moved into a separate folder for better file organisation. This was a simple fix and only  
required the file paths of the favicons to be updated. 
 
- The social media links in the footer were not working. On further investigation, I found  
that the links all had an extra `</a>` tag. To fix this, I removed all unwanted tags from the  
links and made sure that the links worked before moving on.
  
- After applying styling to webpage links in the footer, I found that the styling didn’t take  
effect. To fix this, I had to remove a more specific CSS rule, as this was overriding the  
code I wanted to take effect.
  
- Images across the website were taking too long to load, and knowing that once the  
recipes page was populated with a larger category of recipe images this issue would  
become more apparent. After some research, I came across this article explaining the  
pros and cons of the `.webp` file format (see credits). After converting the images on my  
site to `.webp` I uploaded them as the primary image, which fixed the problem.
  
- The images at the top of the About section and the recipe pages were left with too much  
space around them on screen with widths between 520px and 590px. To fix this, I  
changes the `/* Media query: large or landscape phones (576px and up) */` to take effect  
on screens 500px and up instead.

- W3C Markup Validator flagged up errors across all recipe pages due to a missing  
header element. To fix this, I added `<h3>` elements where needed and gave them a .hidden  
class. 
 
- As part of the testing phase of the website, I used Google’s Lighthouse developer tool to  
help identify areas for improvement. As a result, I identified that pages with images were  
scoring low on performance. Upon doing some research, I found that I could delay the  
loading of images with the loading attribute. I used this to fix the issue by applying a  
delay to images loading nearer the bottom of the page, and a priority to images  
displaying towards the top.
 
- During the development of the project, the cloud-based IDE froze prior to me being able  
to commit my most recent code. A working solution I identified for this was to copy my  
code into a text document constantly until the point of commit. So on a few occasions  
my commits will show larger chunks of changed code than I intended.
