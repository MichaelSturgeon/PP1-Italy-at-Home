                    <p>Their origin goes back to when Sicily was under Arab rule in the 10th century, and traders
                        devised a way to transport meals consisting of rice and meat long distances on horseback. Today,
                        they are one of the highlights of Palermo's street food scene and not terribly difficult to make
                        yourself.</p>

                    <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>Canola or vegetable oil (for frying; about 6 cups)</li>

                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring 3½ cups low-sodium homemade chicken stock or store-bought broth to a simmer in a medium
                        pot over medium heat, then keep warm over low.</li>
                    <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium. Add 1 medium onion, finely
                        chopped, and cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, 4-5 minutes. Add 2 garlic
                        cloves, thinly sliced, and cook, stirring constantly, until softened but not browned, about 1
                        more minute.</li>
                    <li>Stir in 1 cup carnaroli rice or arborio rice; season with 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp.
                        Morton kosher salt. Cook, stirring often, until some of the grains turn translucent around the
                        edges, about 3 minutes. Add ½ cup dry white wine and cook, stirring often, until pan is almost
                        dry, about 2 minutes. Ladle in 1 cup warm stock, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring often,
                        until liquid is absorbed, about 4 minutes. Ladle in another 1 cup stock and continue to cook,
                        stirring yet again, until most of the liquid is absorbed, 5-7 minutes. Add remaining 1½ cups
                        stock and cook, stirring often, until rice is cooked through but retains some bite and liquid is
                        mostly absorbed, 9-11 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Stir in 2 oz. finely grated Parmesan
                        cheese (about 1 cup), ¼ cup heavy cream, 2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon
                        juice, 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, and remaining 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter. Season risotto
                        with kosher salt.</li>
                    <li>Spread risotto in an even layer on a rimmed, parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate at least
                        1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Do Ahead: Risotto can be prepared and chilled 24 hours in advance. Cover with plastic wrap after
                        1 hour so it doesn't develop a skin.</li>
                    <li>Line another rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop about ¼ cup risotto into your hands
                        and form into a patty about 2½" in diameter (it doesn't need to be perfect!). Place 2-3 pieces
                        mozzarella from 3 oz. low-moisture mozzarella cheese, cut into ⅓" pieces, in the center of
                        patty. Carefully pinch and shape risotto so it completely encases the cheese, then roll into a
                        2" ball. Your hands might get messy, and the balls may be slightly misshapen (they'll firm up
                        later). Place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining risotto and mozzarella. Freeze
                        rice balls 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, pulse 2 cups panko in a food processor or place in a ziptop plastic bag and crush
                        with a rolling pin until finer crumbs form. Transfer to a shallow bowl. Place ½ cup all-purpose
                        flour in another shallow bowl. Lightly beat 2 large eggs in a third shallow bowl to blend;
                        season all bowls with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Working one at a time, dredge
                        rice balls in flour, shaking off excess. Transfer to bowl with egg and turn to coat, letting
                        excess drip back into bowl. Coat with panko, pressing gently to adhere. Transfer to a
                        parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Chill rice balls while you heat oil.</li>
                    <li>Pour canola or vegetable oil (about 6 cups) into a medium heavy pot fitted with thermometer to a
                        depth of 2". Warm oil over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 350°. Carefully lower
                        half of rice balls into oil with a slotted spoon or spider and fry until deeply golden brown,
                        6-8 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain; season with salt. Repeat with remaining batch of
                        rice balls.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Let the rice balls rest. Allowing the arancini to firm up briefly in the refrigerator or freezer
                        before breading and frying will help them keep their shape.</li>
                    <li>Using panko bread crumbs (flaky Japanese bread crumbs made from crustless white bread) instead
                        of traditional Italian-style breadcrumbs will result in a lighter crunch since it absorbs less
                        oil deep-frying. Blitzing the panko in a food processor first will give the crust an even finer
                        texture and help the crumbs adhere.</li>
                </ul>
